**Bash scripts for automating AWS EC2 and IAM key rotation.**

These bash scripts are used to automate key rotation for AWS. They are the companion code to this blog article:
[Strengthen Your AWS Security by Protecting App Credentials and Automating EC2 and IAM Key Rotation]
(http://www.randomant.net/strengthen-your-aws-security-by-protecting-app-credentials-and-automating-ec2-and-iam-key-rotation)


**rotate-ec2-key.sh** is a bash script that rotates EC2 SSH keys. It is has been tested with Ubuntu, Amazon Linux and CoreOS.
CoreOS does not support EC2 key rotation if you are using [cloud-config](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/cloud-config.html).
It only works if you use CoreOS's new initialization/provisioning system
[Ignition](https://coreos.com/ignition/docs/0.2.1/what-is-ignition.html). See the blog article referenced above for more details
on why Ignition is required.

The script follows the process below to rotate the key:

1. Create a new key pair using ssh-keygen (not using AWS’s key pair functionality.)
2. Add the public key portion of the SSH key pair to the `~./ssh/authorized_keys` file for the root/admin account on the EC2 instance.
3. Test by logging into the instance with the new key.
4. For CoreOS instances: If everything works, remove the original key by replacing the SSH key in
the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys.d/coreos-ignition` file and run update-ssh-key to enable the change. For other
distros: If everything works, remove the original key from the `~./ssh/authorized_keys` file.
5. Re-test to confirm it still works.
6. Create/update a tag called “EC2KeyName” that contains the name of the new SSH key

The rotate-ec2-key.sh script accepts the following command line options:

      usage: rotate-ec2-key.sh [options...]
      options:
      -s --ssh-key-file  Path to EC2 private ssh key file for the key to be replaced. Required.
      -h --host          IP address or DNS name for the EC2 instance. Required.
      -a --aws-key-file  The file for the .csv access key file for an AWS administrator. Optional. The AWS
                         administrator must have the rights to create tags for EC2 instances. The script
                         expects the .csv format used when you download the key from IAM in the AWS console.
                         If you don't specify a key file, the script will use your existing CLI
                         configuration settings.
                         the default credentials in ~/.aws/credentials will be used.
      -u --user          Root/admin user for the EC2 instance. Optional. The default value is 'core' (for
                         the CoreOS distro).
      -j --json          A file to send JSON output to. Optional.
         --help          Prints this help message


**rotate-iam-key.sh** is a bash script that rotates an IAM user's key. The script follows the process below to rotate the key:

1. Create a new (second) access key for the user.
2. Test the application code with the new key.
3. If nothing breaks, de-activate the old key.
4. Re-test.
5. If nothing breaks, delete the old key.

The script does a fairly simple test in step #4: it merely attempts to list the access keys for the user, and if it’s successful,
the test passes. The actual tests used in your production environment will likely be more extensive and will vary based
on your business requirements.

The rotate-iam-key.sh script accepts the following command line options:

    usage: rotate-iam-user-key.sh [options...]
    options:
     -a --aws-key-file  The file for the .csv access key file for an AWS administrator. Optional. The AWS administrator must
                        have the rights to list and update credentials for the IAM user. The script expects the .csv format
                        used when you download the key from IAM in the AWS console. If this option is not specified,
                        existing AWS CLI credentials must be already defined and are used.
		 -p --profile       If using a AWS credential profile, specify the name of the profile here to rotate
		                    it's credentials.
     -c --csv-key-file  The name of the output .csv file containing the new access key information. Optional.
     -u --user          The IAM user whose key you want to rotate. Required.
     -j --json          A file to send JSON output to. Optional.
     -r --reconfigure   Set AWS CLI to use new credentials
        --help          Prints this help message
